      description:
        'All-on-X dental implant treatment is a revolutionary procedure where four or more implants are placed in your jawbone to support a full arch of replacement teeth. This technique offers an excellent alternative to traditional dentures and implant-supported overdentures by providing a fixed, non-removable solution. You won’t have to worry about slipping dentures or applying adhesive cream—the hybrid denture is securely anchored to your jaw with implants.',

      title: 'How Does All-on-4 or All-on-6 Work?',
      description:
        'In All-on-4 or All-on-6 treatments, 4 to 6 implants are strategically placed in the jaw to support a fixed dental prosthesis. A framework is then secured to these implants, and the artificial teeth are attached to this framework. This gives you a full arch of teeth that are stable, comfortable, and natural-looking, allowing you to enjoy all your daily activities without the worry of dentures shifting or falling out.',

          'One of the most significant advantages of All-on-X is that the dentures are fixed in place, eliminating the need for messy adhesives or concerns about dentures slipping out. With no material covering the roof of your mouth (palate), you’ll enjoy improved speech, better tasting food, and a more comfortable fit compared to traditional dentures.',

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">What’s the Difference Between All-on-X and Implant-Supported Overdentures?</h3>
  <div>
  While both All-on-X and implant-supported overdentures use dental implants, they differ in how the prosthetic teeth are attached. All-on-X provides a fixed denture, while implant-supported overdentures can be removed for cleaning. Both options offer stability, but All-on-X offers the advantage of being a permanent solution, with no need to remove the denture.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>All-on-X Hybrid Dentures</strong>: The denture is fixed permanently and is not removed. This offers the closest alternative to natural teeth in terms of function, stability, and aesthetics.</li>
    <li><strong>Implant-Supported Overdenture</strong>: A removable option that uses 2-4 implants with locator attachments to snap the denture into place. This provides more stability than traditional dentures but requires daily removal for cleaning.</li>

        'The All-on-X procedure typically starts with a comprehensive consultation, including X-rays and digital imaging to determine the best implant placement.
