        'A fixed dental bridge is a dental restoration used to replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring an artificial tooth (or teeth) between two crowns placed on the adjacent natural teeth or dental implants. This bridge is permanently bonded and can only be removed by a dentist. Fixed bridges restore not only your smile but also your ability to chew, speak, and maintain proper facial structure.',

  <div>
  The procedure to receive a fixed dental bridge involves several steps, typically completed over two or more visits. Here’s what to expect:
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Consultation</strong>: Your dentist will evaluate your oral health and determine if a fixed bridge is right for you. This may involve X-rays and digital scans of your teeth to assess the condition of the abutment teeth (supporting teeth).</li>
    <li><strong>Tooth Preparation</strong>: The abutment teeth are reshaped to make room for the crowns that will hold the bridge in place. A mold or digital impression is taken to create a custom-fit bridge.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary Bridge</strong>: While your permanent bridge is being fabricated, a temporary bridge is placed to protect the abutment teeth and gums.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Placement</strong>: Once your permanent bridge is ready, your dentist will fit and cement it in place. Adjustments will be made to ensure the perfect fit and comfort.</li>
  </ul>
