        'Gum disease, or periodontal disease, is a common but preventable condition. It starts with plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth. If plaque is not removed, it hardens into tartar, which can only be removed by a dental professional. Tartar buildup can lead to gingivitis, the early stage of gum disease, characterized by red, swollen gums that may bleed easily. Without intervention, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a more severe form of gum disease that can result in tooth loss. Regular dental cleanings remove plaque and tartar, significantly reducing your risk of developing gum disease.',

          'The first step in the cleaning process is the removal of plaque and tartar using a scaler. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that constantly forms on your teeth, and if it’s not removed, it can harden into tartar. Tartar is firmly attached to the tooth surface and can only be removed with professional tools. The hygienist will carefully scrape the tartar from your teeth, focusing on the gum line and between your teeth where plaque and tartar often accumulate.',

The fluoride treatment may be applied as a gel, foam, or varnish, and it is typically left on your teeth for a few minutes to allow it to take effect. The treatment provides an added layer of protection against cavities until your next cleaning."

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">How Often Should You Schedule a Dental Cleaning?
</h3>
  <div>
  The frequency of your dental cleanings depends on your individual oral health needs. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that most people have their teeth professionally cleaned at least twice a year. However, if you have a history of gum disease, are prone to cavities, or have other oral health concerns, your dentist may recommend more frequent cleanings.
  </div>

  <div>
  Regular dental visits allow your dentist to monitor your oral health and catch any potential issues early, before they become more serious. By keeping up with your cleanings, you can enjoy a lifetime of healthy teeth and gums.

</h3>
  <div>
  Preventive dentistry focuses on maintaining optimal oral health through regular dental care, including cleanings, exams, and patient education. Dental cleaning is a cornerstone of preventive dentistry, as it helps to prevent common dental issues such as cavities, gum disease, and enamel erosion.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div>
In addition to regular cleanings, preventive dentistry involves educating patients on proper brushing and flossing techniques, dietary habits that promote oral health, and the use of preventive treatments such as fluoride and dental sealants. By taking a proactive approach to your oral health, you can prevent the need for more invasive and costly dental treatments in the future.  </div>
