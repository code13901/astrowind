          <li><strong>Zirconia</strong>: Strong and durable, these crowns offer a good balance between appearance and strength.</li>

          <li><strong>Chipping or Cracking</strong>: Although durable, crowns can still be damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Loose or Dislodged Crown</strong>: If the underlying tooth structure deteriorates, the crown may loosen or fall off.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Crowns can be expensive, depending on the material used and the complexity of the procedure.</li>
