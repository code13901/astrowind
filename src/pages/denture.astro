  <div>
  Choosing the right denture depends on several factors, including the number of teeth missing, the condition of your remaining teeth, and your budget. Here’s a quick overview of the key benefits of each type:
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Removable Resin Partial Denture</strong>: A cost-effective solution for replacing a few teeth with a natural-looking appearance.</li>
    <li><strong>Complete Denture</strong>: Ideal for those who are missing all teeth in one or both arches and want a full-arch solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Cast Partial Denture</strong>: A more durable and stable option for patients who need a partial denture but want the added support of a metal framework.</li>
    <li><strong>Immediate Denture</strong>: A great temporary solution while healing after extractions, with the option for a more permanent denture later.</li>
