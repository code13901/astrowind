          'Tooth extraction is a procedure where a tooth is removed from its socket in the jawbone. There are two main types of tooth extractions: Simple extraction (for visible teeth) and surgical extraction (for impacted teeth or those that haven’t fully erupted).

  <div>
  The tooth extraction process varies depending on the type of extraction needed. Here's a step-by-step overview of what you can expect during both simple and surgical extractions:
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consultation and X-rays</strong>: Your dentist will first evaluate your oral health and take X-rays to assess the condition of the tooth and surrounding bone. This helps in planning the procedure.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Anesthesia</strong>: Before extraction, local anesthesia will be administered to numb the area around the tooth, ensuring that you feel no pain during the procedure. For more complex cases, sedation may be offered.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple Extraction</strong>: The dentist will use an instrument called an elevator to loosen the tooth before removing it with forceps.</li>
    <li><strong>Surgical Extraction</strong>: For surgical extractions, an incision may be made in the gum, and the tooth may need to be sectioned for easier removal.</li>
