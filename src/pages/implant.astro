      description:
        'Dental implants are titanium posts that are surgically placed into the jawbone, providing a sturdy foundation for replacement teeth. They fuse with the bone to create a secure and long-lasting solution for missing teeth. Unlike dentures or bridges, implants function like your natural teeth, allowing you to eat, speak, and smile with confidence.',

      title: 'Why Choose Dental Implants?',
      description:
        'Dental implants offer numerous advantages over other tooth replacement options. They prevent bone loss, maintain facial structure, and are incredibly durable. Implants do not require altering nearby teeth, which means they preserve your natural tooth structure. They are also comfortable, stable, and indistinguishable from natural teeth.',

    {
      title: 'Types of Dental Implants',
      description:
        'Depending on your needs and jawbone condition, you may be a candidate for one of several types of dental implants: Endosteal implants (placed directly in the bone), Subperiosteal implants (placed on top of the jawbone), or All-on-4 implants (supporting a full arch of teeth). Your dentist will determine the best option based on your unique situation.',

    {
      title: 'Am I a Candidate for Dental Implants?',
      description:
        'Not everyone is an immediate candidate for dental implants. You need to have healthy gums and enough bone structure to support the implant. If your jawbone has deteriorated, a bone graft may be necessary. People with certain conditions like uncontrolled diabetes or heavy smokers may need additional treatment or alternatives.
