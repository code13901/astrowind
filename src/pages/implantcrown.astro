      description:
        'An implant crown is a single tooth replacement that is supported by a dental implant. After a titanium implant post is surgically placed into your jawbone, a custom-made crown is attached to the implant, restoring both the function and appearance of the missing tooth. Implant crowns are designed to look and feel like your natural teeth, providing a seamless and durable solution.',

      title: 'What is an Implant-Supported Bridge?',
      description:
        'An implant-supported bridge is used to replace multiple missing teeth. Rather than placing individual implants for each missing tooth, two or more implants are strategically placed to support a dental bridge. The bridge consists of crowns that span the gap, supported by the implants at either end. This solution is ideal for patients who are missing several teeth in a row.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Why Choose Dental Implants?',
      description:
        'Dental implants are the gold standard for tooth replacement because they offer superior stability and longevity compared to traditional bridges or dentures. They mimic natural tooth roots, providing a secure foundation for crowns or bridges, and they help prevent bone loss in the jaw, which can occur after tooth loss.',

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">How Does the Implant Procedure Work?</h3>
  <div>
  The implant procedure typically begins with a comprehensive consultation, where we assess your oral health and take X-rays or digital images to determine the best implant placement. The dental implant is surgically placed into your jawbone, and after a healing period (typically 3-4 months), the implant fuses with the bone in a process called osseointegration. Once the implant has healed, the custom-made crown or bridge is attached to the implant post.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Consultation</strong>: Your dentist will evaluate your teeth and gums, and discuss your smile goals. If implants are suitable for you, imaging will be done to create a treatment plan.</li>
    <li><strong>Surgical Placement</strong>: The implant post is surgically placed into the jawbone. This post acts as the foundation for the crown or bridge.</li>
    <li><strong>Healing Period</strong>: After the implant is placed, the bone will need time to fuse with the implant. This healing process can take several months.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Restoration</strong>: Once healed, the final crown or bridge is attached to the implant, completing your new, natural-looking smile.</li>
