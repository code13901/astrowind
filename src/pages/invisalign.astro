  <div>
  Your journey to a straighter smile with Invisalign is a straightforward and personalized process. Here’s an overview of what you can expect during your treatment:
  </div>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Consultation</strong>: Your dentist will evaluate your teeth and discuss your smile goals. If Invisalign is the right choice for you, digital impressions or scans of your teeth will be taken.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Treatment Plan</strong>: Using advanced 3D imaging, your dentist will create a customized treatment plan that shows the step-by-step movement of your teeth. You’ll even be able to see a preview of your new smile.</li>
    <li><strong>Wearing the Aligners</strong>: Once your aligners are ready, you’ll wear each set for about 20-22 hours a day, changing to a new set every 1-2 weeks as your teeth gradually shift into place.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Checkups</strong>: Every 6-8 weeks, you’ll visit your dentist or orthodontist to monitor your progress and receive your next sets of aligners. The entire treatment usually lasts between 12-18 months, depending on the complexity of your case.</li>
    <li><strong>Retainers</strong>: After completing the Invisalign treatment, you’ll need to wear a retainer to maintain your newly aligned smile and prevent your teeth from shifting back to their original position.</li>
  </ul>
